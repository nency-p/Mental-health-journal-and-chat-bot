Mental Health Journal & Chat Bot
=================================

Files:
- index.html         -> Main HTML page (references styles.css & script.js)
- styles.css         -> Styling for the app
- script.js          -> JavaScript logic for journal + chat

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder and open index.html in a browser.
2. The app runs fully client-side (no backend required).
3. Entries are stored only in memory (page reload clears entries). You can extend it to use localStorage or a backend.

Created from the user's provided single-file HTML and split into separate files for clarity.
